## Hi, I'm Sai

I'm an indie developer interested in desktop applications, software
architecture and building tools meant for daily use.

I enjoy working on long-term, thoughtful projects with a focus on
simplicity, performance and user comfort.

### Current focus
- Orbit Browser — a calm, personal desktop web browser (Windows-first)
- UI foundations and product design
- Desktop app architecture

### Principles
- Build slowly and intentionally
- Comfort over hype
- Personal software over mass-market products

### Notes
This profile reflects ongoing work and experimentation.
